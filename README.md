Here's a little repo to allow you to fork all U.S. government repos, on the off-chance the originals disappear in the next few years.
If you have a git username and ouath key, you can fork the repos yourself using the DolleyMadison class.

To fork all of the repos:

```
composer install
php run.php
```
TODOs:
* Make a CLI client
* Tests
* Error Logging
* Generally make it less dumb.
* Update the docblocks
